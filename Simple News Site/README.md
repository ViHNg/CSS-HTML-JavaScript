Creative Portion:
1. We added the Delete User functionality.
2. We displayed the timestamps for what time each comment was posted. We created a separate field in the comment table to store the timestamp of each comment. 
3. Share on Twitter functionality: Users can share each story card on Twitter. The link automatically creates the post for them with the caption filled in.
4. Likes/upvotes: we created a separate field in the comment table to store each comment's 'like' count.
